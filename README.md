Computation of sound stability scores
===
* Java code resides in code directory
* setting up the environment:
  * clone the repository and recursively update the submodules
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jdellert/icon-evol.git
  cd icon-evol
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
  * recommended: import as a project into IntelliJ (.iml file is in repository)
  * otherwise (e.g. in Eclipse): import as Maven project (pom.xml is in repository),  
    manually configure relevant folders from submodules as additional source folders
* reproducing our results:
