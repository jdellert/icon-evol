Computation of sound stability scores
===
* Java code resides in code directory

Setting up the environment
---
* clone the repository and recursively update the submodules
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jdellert/icon-evol.git
  cd icon-evol/code
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
* recommended: import as a project into IntelliJ (iconevol.iml in code directory)
* otherwise (e.g. in Eclipse): import as Maven project (pom.xml in code directory),  
  manually configure relevant folders from submodules as additional source folders
